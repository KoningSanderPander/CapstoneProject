In short the app will allow people to automatically log their time at work.
Without having to manually start and stop a timer.

From my personal experience I've noticed that most apps offices have
some kind of time tracking system. Most of the times this is done with a
central station and a card containing an nfc chip. But these systems are
slow and annoying to use. When everyone has break time there is always a
queue at the check-in/check-out station.

The goal of this project is to eliminate the need for those central
systems with an app on your phone. This app will use geo fencing
techniques to calculate when to start and stop logging your time at work.
